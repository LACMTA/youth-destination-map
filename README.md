## Destinations

We asked attendees of the 2023 Youth Summit, the members of the 2024 Youth Council, and peers of the 2024 Youth council to provide destinations for this map - places they like to visit, hidden gems that other teens should know about, etc.

We use the Google Places API to auto-suggest locations and we only save destinations that are in Google's database.

The resulting data still needed to be filtered out for:

* Airports, airlines
* K-12 schools
* Places outside of LA County that Metro does not serve.
* Places that were not specific enough
* Places where it was unclear why it was being recommended.
* Ferries, islands, cruise piers

Additionally, duplicates needed to be combined.

In 2024, users were also asked to submit their first name and why they were recommending a place.
